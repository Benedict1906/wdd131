      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This website is a personal photography portfolio that highlights my
        work, offers booking options, and provides insight into my creative
        process. It will serve both as a professional presence and an
        interactive experience for visitors.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The audience includes photography enthusiasts, clients looking to hire a
        photographer for events or portraits, and anyone interested in visual
        storytelling and creative inspiration.
      </p>

      <h3>Dynamic Elements</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript will power an interactive photo gallery with filtering
        options, a dynamic hero image that changes daily, and modals for viewing
        images in full screen. Additional elements will include navigation
        toggling and user feedback based on gallery interaction.
